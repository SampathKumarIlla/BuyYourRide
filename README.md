### Introduction
The "Buy Your First Ride Dashboard" provides an in-depth analysis of various factors influencing the purchase of cars over the years. It presents a comprehensive view of trends in transmission types by brand, owner distance by brand, car pricing by seats, and other essential metrics that guide first-time car buyers. The dashboard is segmented into different visualizations, each targeting a specific aspect of car purchasing behaviour from 1994 to 2020.

### Insights
### Transmission Types by Brand:
The trend in transmission types across different brands shows that automatic transmission types have consistently increased in popularity, with a significant spike after 2010. On the other hand, manual transmissions have seen a steadier, more gradual increase in average starting prices, remaining lower than their automatic counterparts.
Counts of Variations by Brands:
The count of car variations by brands shows a consistent rise from 2005 to 2015, with a noticeable peak around 2013. Post-2015, thereâ€™s a slight decline, indicating a possible market saturation or a shift in consumer preferences.

### Owner Distance by Brand:
The pie chart reveals the distribution of owner distances by various brands. It highlights that a specific brand (labeled as B3) accounts for the largest proportion, indicating it is either a popular choice for long-distance drivers or it is associated with owners who retain their cars longer.

### Car Pricing by Seats:
Car pricing by seats shows that 4-seater vehicles are the most expensive, followed by 6-seaters and 8-seaters. This may suggest that 4-seaters are in higher demand, perhaps due to their balance between size, fuel efficiency, and affordability.

### Distribution of Vehicle Types:
The lower right corner bar chart highlights that diesel vehicles are more prevalent than petrol and other types, particularly in large cars. This could be due to their better fuel efficiency and lower running costs, which are appealing for larger vehicles.

### Conclusion
The dashboard provides a clear snapshot of the car market trends over two decades, highlighting key insights that could assist first-time buyers in making informed decisions. The increasing preference for automatic transmission, the predominance of 4-seater cars in pricing, and the distribution of vehicle types by fuel type underscore evolving consumer priorities. This data-driven analysis can guide buyers towards choices that align with market trends, their budget, and their long-term needs.
